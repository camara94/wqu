    "Another way to identify anomalies is by comparing current data to historical data. In the case of identifying sites of drug abuse, we might compare a practice's current rate of opioid prescription to their rate 5 or 10 years ago. Unless the nature of the practice has changed, the profile of drugs they prescribe should be relatively stable. We might also want to identify trends through time for business reasons, identifying drugs that are gaining market share. That's what we'll do in this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll load in beneficiary data from 6 months earlier, June 2016, and calculate the percent growth in prescription rate from June 2016 to January 2017 for each `bnf_name`. We'll return the 50 items with largest growth and the 50 items with the largest shrinkage (i.e. negative percent growth) as a list of tuples sorted by growth rate in descending order in the format `(script_name, growth_rate, raw_2016_count)`. You'll notice that many of the 50 fastest growing items have low counts of prescriptions in 2016. Filter out any items that were prescribed less than 50 times."

    "Does a practice's prescription costs originate from routine care or from reliance on rarely prescribed treatments? Commonplace treatments can carry lower costs than rare treatments because of efficiencies in large-scale production. While some specialist practices can't help but avoid prescribing rare medicines because there are no alternatives, some practices may be prescribing a unnecessary amount of brand-name products when generics are available. Let's identify practices whose costs disproportionately originate from rarely prescribed items.\n",

To do this, find the probability $p$ of a prescription having a particular `'bnf_code'` if the `'bnf_code'` was randomly chosen from the unique options in the beneficiary data. We will call a `'bnf_code'` rare if it is prescribed at a rate less than $0.1p$."
